Given a track before it is released to the public, how do we know if it would be a “hit” song on Spotify, which is the biggest music streaming platform that has 170 million worldwide users? Without any marketing strategy or promotion, only from the track attributes: title, artist, producers, lyrics, melodies, is it sufficient to predict its success? 

We are using machine learning techniques to take 14k Warner Music songs and lyrics and trying to predict their popularity on Spotify.
